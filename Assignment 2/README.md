To assess my submission, first open a terminal, set the folder holding my code as the working directory and run:

    node app.js

Then, in another terminal (with the same setup and without closing the first), run:

    npm test

Please note that I could not get the testing rig to stop showing the test for number of dead between two dates as a failure. I also couldn't get the timing to work on the console.log,
so it prints the number of dead in between the other test outputs. Sorry.

Additionally, the test will say failed by timeout, which I also couldn't fix.
