To access and assess my submission, please write the following into the terminal:

    node mainprogram.mjs [the path of the file with the student information]

For example, using the example student information file we were given, you would write:

    node mainprogram.mjs ./students.txt

This will log all of the errors thrown by the add() method for the student's given course list.
